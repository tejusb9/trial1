            <h1>The Genre Mosaic</h1>
            <p>India's gaming palate is as diverse as its cuisine. The strategy and the 
                thrill of the shooting games command the lion's share of consumer spend, 
                while the hypercasual genre—a genre that epitomizes the 'pick up and play' 
                ethos—dominates downloads. This mosaic of preferences paints a picture of 
                a nation that values both the quick adrenaline rush and the slow, 
                strategic burn.</p>
