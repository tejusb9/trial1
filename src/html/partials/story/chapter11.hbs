            <h1>A Nation of Gamers</h1>
            <p>India's gaming story is narrated by its 500 million gamersâ€”the 
                second-largest gaming cohort worldwide. With a median age of 25 and a 
                burgeoning middle class, the gaming narrative is young, vibrant, and full 
                of potential. The Statista report's map does more than show numbers; it 
                illuminates a demographic revolution, a subcontinent united by the love of 
                gaming, poised to expand even further into the digital age.</p>
            <p>As we turn the page on India's gaming economy, the future chapters 
                promise to be filled with innovation, expansion, and the thrill of 
                the game. The digital playgrounds of India are bustling with activity, 
                and the world is starting to take notice.</p>
